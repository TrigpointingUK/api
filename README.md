# TrigpointingUK - API

## Source code for TrigpointingUK API.

The current TrigpointingUK website uses outdated PHP code, which does not meet modern
security expectations, and which relies on AWS functionality due to be deprecated in
August 2022. This repo houses the development of a more cloud native codebase.
